## Overview

**Constraints_Modeling** is an educational and practical toolkit for working with constraint programming and combinatorial optimization. The repository demonstrates how to model, solve, and analyze constraint problems using multiple languages and paradigms.

Supported languages:
- **Java** 
- **Python** 
- **MiniZinc** 

## Features

p-center (5-10 facilities, 5-10 clients)
p-center with distance constraints (5-10 facilities, 5-10 clients)
p-dispersion (5-10 facilities)
p-dispersion with distance constraints (5-10 facilities)

 
## Requirements

- **Java 8+**
- **Python 3.7+**
- **MiniZinc IDE**
